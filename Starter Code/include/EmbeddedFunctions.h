	/**
	* Closes a connection to a Galil Controller.
	* *gclib* requires that `GClose()` be called whenever a program is finished with a controller. This includes when a program closes. A rule of thumb is that for every `GOpen()` call on a given connection, a `GClose()` call should be found on every code path. Failing to call GClose() may cause controller resources to not be released or can hang the process if there are outstanding asynchronous operations. The latter can occur, for example, if a call to GRead() times out and the process exits without calling GClose(). In this case, GRead() still has an outstanding asynchronous read pending. GClose() will terminate this operation allowing the process to exit correctly.

	* @param g Connection's handle.

	*
	* @param g Connection's handle.
	* @param command Null-terminated command string to send to the controller. The library will append a carriage return to the command string.
	* @param buffer Buffer for the response. Will be filled with the response from the controller. The data will be null terminated unless function returns `G_BAD_LOST_DATA` due to the buffer being too small to hold the data.
	* @param buffer_len The size of the response buffer.
	* @param bytes_returned The size of the data returned from the controller. This does not include null termination. This argument may be null if the value is not desired.
